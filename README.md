# AI and Machine Learning Projects

I am a Master's student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Luleå University of Technology, based in Stockholm, Sweden.  
With over 10 years of professional experience in software testing and automation at Infosys, Deloitte USI, and SEB, I am now transitioning into software development with a focus on Machine Learning and MLOps.
